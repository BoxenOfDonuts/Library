# Thoughts... :thinking:
This one wasn't quite as hard as the calculator one, the logic was simpler that is for sure. The local storage was pretty simple to set up as well It defenitely was more of a challenge to style though. I'm *okay* with how it turned out but at some point I need to come back and make it look nice. I saw other projects that have an outline of the 'book div' to add and I want to do something like that.
